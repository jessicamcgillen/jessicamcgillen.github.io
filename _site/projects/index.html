  <summary><b>Consequences of a changing U.S. strategy for global AIDS investment</b></summary>
  <p></p><p>Recent political changes have brought U.S. investment in global health into heightened focus. Preliminary budget proposals released by the Trump White House have hinted at a commitment to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund, though this may be limited and full details are not yet known. Editorials have discussed the importance of U.S. funding from the perspectives of human rights, global relations, and national security, but the conversation has been missing estimates of the impact that changes in U.S. funding could have on the epidemic.</p> <p>At the request of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) and Friends of the Global Fight, I have used a model of HIV in Africa to analyse a range of plausible strategies for how the new U.S. government might contribute to, or withdraw from, international response efforts going forward. My findings suggest that budget cuts or even a deviation in programmatic focus would dramatically hinder efforts to reach UNAIDS targets for incidence and death reduction.</p><p>This work has been submitted for publication and is being shared in the form of policy briefs with PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and members of the 115th US Congress for use in their budget deliberations.</p>

  <summary><b>Global Fund replenishment campaign and strategy for 2017–2022</b></summary>
  <p></p><p>The Global Fund is the world's largest catalyst of the fight against HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. Operating as a financing institution, it raises and manages multilateral funds, leverages public-private partnerships, and invests to support treatment, prevention, and care services in countries in need. The Fund appeals to donor countries for financial replenishment in three-year cycles.</p><p>At the request of the Fund's division of strategic information, I carried out consulting work to inform and strengthen the 2017 replenishment campaign. Together with Avenir Health and malaria modellers at Imperial, I explored the potential impact that a fully-funded Global Fund could have on each epidemic, as well as the losses that could be seen under incomplete funding or ineffective spending.</p><p>Following the successful replenishment, I aggregated modelling results across HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to identify indicators for impact and service delivery that will guide the Global Fund's board-approved strategy over the new funding period.</p>

  <summary><b>Evaluation of HIV prevention programmes in Zambia and Zimbabwe</b></summary>
  <p></p><p>Since 2009, Zimbabwe and Zambia have been scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision, an intervention that reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by up to 60%. In collaboration with Avenir Health, the Institute for Disease Research, and Weill Cornell Medicine, I am using modelling to provide interim evaluations of the ongoing circumcision programmes.</p><p>In a completed first phase, my collaborators and I found that both countries will need to ramp up circumcision rates in order to meet their targets, but that the circumcisions already performed have had an impact on the local epidemics. We presented these findings to stakeholders and in-country programme coordinators at workshops in Harare and Lusaka, and will update our conclusions as new data come available.</p>

  <summary><b>The role of PrEP in combination HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa</b></summary>
  <p></p><p>New guidelines from the World Health Organisation recommend offering pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to people who are at substantial risk of HIV infection. But where PrEP should be prioritised, and for which population groups, remains an open question—and, for sub-Saharan Africa, a complex one.</p><p>I used modelling to examine what role PrEP should play in the heterogeneous and resource-limited landscape of sub-Saharan Africa. I found that using a fixed incidence benchmark to guide the allocation of PrEP would incur a loss in impact compared to an approach that uses PrEP more flexibly in light of prevailing budget conditions. This work has been published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5071752/">Journal of the International AIDS Society</a>.</p>

  <summary><b>How to optimally reduce HIV incidence across sub-Saharan Africa</b></summary>
  <p></p><p>Advances in HIV prevention methods offer promise to accelerate declines in incidence, but it has been unclear how these can be deployed to best effect in the complex setting of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>I hypothesised that tailoring prevention to local epidemic patterns could enhance the impact of HIV investments on a large scale. To test this, I developed a mathematical model of HIV transmission at subnational resolution in 18 sub-Saharan African countries. The model was calibrated to local historical data on HIV prevalence, sexual behaviours, treatment scale-up, and demographics. I then evaluated a series of different strategies for distributing prevention funding over 2016–2030.</p><p>According to the model, shifting from the current to optimal funding pattern would rebalance resources toward more cost-effective interventions and emerging epidemics, and would enable a much greater impact than current spending. This suggests that if domestic and international funders were to align strategically to build an aggregate funding pattern guided by epidemiology, more cost-effective and impactful HIV investments could be achieved across sub-Saharan Africa. This work has been published in <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(16)30051-0/fulltext">The Lancet HIV</a>.</p><p>I am now beginning to examine the impact of real-world constraints on the optimal funding pattern—for example, geopolitics of funding decisions, health system capacity, and the socioeconomic context in which people seek care or prevention.</p>
