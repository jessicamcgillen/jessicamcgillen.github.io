<p>In my current position with the <a href="http://www.hivmodelling.org/">HIV Modelling Consortium</a> at Imperial College London, I specialise in using mathematical modelling to inform global health policy.</p>

<p>I am interested in understanding how global health policy should respond to shifting donor priorities and evolving epidemics as the world moves toward ambitious development goals for 2030.</p>

<p>Recently I have supported the 2017 Global Fund replenishment campaign, made a case for continued U.S. investment in the global AIDS response in the face of a changing political climate, and evaluated on-the-ground HIV prevention programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Imperial, I earned a DPhil in mathematical biology from Oxford University. In my thesis, entitled <a href="http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.627871">Mathematical Modelling of Metabolism and Acidity in Cancer</a>, I developed spatial models of altered metabolism and nutrient supply in growing tumours. I also have a masters in computational biology and undergraduate degrees in biology and statistics from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<p>I am currently based in New York.</p>
