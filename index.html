	I'm Jessica McGillen, a postdoctoral researcher and consultant at Imperial College London working at the interface between disease modelling and global health policy.
	</p>

	<p>
	I aim to understand large-scale patterns in global health investments and identify opportunities to improve their impact.

	I love writing and see it as fundamental to good science and policy. At various points I've co-authored peer-reviewed <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GUMB_uoAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a>, been a freelance editor, and written for a software company and a hospital.
