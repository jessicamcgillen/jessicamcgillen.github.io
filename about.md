In my position with the [HIV Modelling Consortium](http://www.hivmodelling.org/) at Imperial College London, I specialise in using mathematical modelling to inform global health policy. My main interest is in determining how global health policy should respond to shifting donor priorities and evolving epidemics as the world moves toward ambitious development goals for 2030.

My recent projects include supporting the 2017 Global Fund replenishment campaign, making a case for continued U.S. investment in the global AIDS response in the face of a changing political climate, and evaluating on-the-ground HIV prevention programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.

Prior to joining Imperial, I earned a DPhil in mathematical biology from Oxford University. In my thesis, entitled [Mathematical Modelling of Metabolism and Acidity in Cancer](http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.627871), I developed spatial models of altered metabolism and nutrient supply in growing tumours. I also have a masters in computational biology and undergraduate degrees in biology and statistics from Carnegie Mellon University.

I am currently based in New York.
